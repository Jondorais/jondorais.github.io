  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>My journey as an animator began when I was 13, and my journey as a filmmaker began 4 years later. Ever since then, I’ve taken my student life as an opportunity to learn as many skills as possible, and it was straight to the drawing board. But it was difficult trying to find work as a cartoonist, and I lacked money or resources. Nevertheless, I still decided to simply go forward and make something for myself – to try something new. I wanted a form of animation that could be faster, affordable, and just as impactful with limited resources.
  </p>
  <p>I came up with a computer animation technique with 2D-looking models inside 3D sets they could interact with. This has become an outlet for two award-winning pilots, and it continues to make seemingly impossible ideas possible. And the possibilities for stories are endless, which is fantastic. I’ve always favored character-driven narratives over anything else. This technique helps that by bringing so many different characters to life. The pieces on this website are a testament to these stories. There is always something to be said, even if it's simple.
