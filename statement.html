  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>My journey as an animator began when I was 13, and my journey as a filmmaker began when 4 years later. Ever since then, I’ve taken my student life as an opportunity to learn as many skills as possible. It was straight to the drawing board after that. I was difficult trying to find work as a cartoonist as a student, and I lacked funding or resources. And so, I decided to just go forward and make something for myself – to try something new. I wanted a form of animation that could be faster, affordable, and just as impactful with limited resources.
  </p>
  <p>I came up with a computer animation technique with 2D-looking models inside interactive 3D sets. This has become an outlet for two award-winning pilots, and it continues to make impossible ideas possible. While comedy has always been a safe space for my creative side, I’ve always favored character-driven narratives over anything else. The pieces on this website are a testament to story. There is always something to be said, even if it's simple.
