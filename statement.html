  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Hi there fellow internet pursuer! You’re probably wondering to yourself, “Why should I visit some random guy’s art portfolio website?” And you’re right to think that to yourself. With all the crazy shenanigans going on the internet, there is so much to immerse yourself in. However, out of all the pointless shenanigans happening on the internet, this is the most pointless of all. But by viewing this art, you’re giving it a purpose. In this website, you’ll find various types of art. They’re a testament to story rather than skill, for there is no point in showcasing art if there isn’t something to be said. 
  </p>
  <p>Art is a peculiar subject. Because regardless of how much work you put into it, the end product is always subjective. However, while quality will always play a part in the competence of the art, I do believe that putting yourself and your view of the world forward is the best way to communicate your art. And that’s what art is, communication. For that reason, it’s become my goal with this website to share with you things done through a peculiar or perhaps familiar perspective that maybe you can connect with. And if not, at least maybe you can enjoy the look of it. With that in mind, I encourage you to check out the various dank art posted on this site.
