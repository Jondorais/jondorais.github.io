  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Hi there fellow internet pursuer! You’re probably wondering to yourself, “Why should I visit some random guy’s art portfolio website?” And you’re right to think that to yourself. With all the crazy shenanigans going on the internet, there is so much to immerse yourself in. However, out of all the pointless shenanigans happening on the internet, this is the most pointless of all. But by viewing this art, you’re giving it a purpose. In this website, you’ll find various types of art, many of which reflect the pointless nature of the internet. And in doing so, it reveals that anything with passion and intent can have always have purpose. These art pieces a testament to story, both personal and fictional, rather than skill, for there is no point in showcasing art if there isn’t something to be said.

  <p>Art is a peculiar subject. Because regardless of how much work you put into it, the end product will always be considered "subjective." However, while quality will always play a part in the competence of the art, putting yourself and your view of the world forward is the best way to communicate your art. And that’s what art is, communication. For that reason, it’s become my goal with this website to share with you parts of the world and my life through a peculiar or perhaps familiar lens. If you can connect with even one thing in my portfoloio, then I've done my job. And if not, at least maybe you can enjoy the look of it. With that in mind, I encourage you to check out my various pieces of art celebrating the weird and conventional - posted on this site!
