    <h1>What is WACKY TOWNS?</h1>
      <p>In May 2018, Jonny Yoon Dorais and Emerson Chan premiered the pilot to Wacky Towns at the San Jose State University FPS Fest. They received the award for Best Picture and later released the pilot on YouTube one month later as they began production for Episode 2. In November 2019, Episode 2 of Wacky Towns was made public as the last episode of the series. A third episode was in the works but was unfortunately cancelled due to the COVID 19 lockdown in 2020. However, more Wacky Towns stories are soon to be expected with an upcoming novel in the works.</p>
