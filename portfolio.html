      <h1>My Artist Statement</h1>
      <p>Hi there! I'm Jon Dorais, or Jonny Yoon Dorais as said on the credits for past productions. I use both my parents names as a way of honoring my family origins from Korea and France. Everybody has a story to tell. And as a student filmmaker and animator, I lacked money or resources for projects. I wanted a form of animation that could be faster, affordable, and just as impactful with limited resources. To fix this problem, I came up with a computer animation technique that used 2D-looking models in 3D sets. This has become an outlet for two award-winning pilots and an independent short film, and it continues to make seemingly impossible ideas possible.</p>
