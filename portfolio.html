      <h1>My Artist Statement</h1>
      <p>Hi there! I'm Jon Dorais, or Jonny Yoon Dorais as credited on past productions. Everybody has a story to tell. As a student filmmaker and animator, I lacked money or resources for projects. There had to be a more efficient technique of animation for my team and me. I wanted to create a style that could be fast, affordable, and impactful. To fix this problem, I came up with a computer animation technique that used 2D-looking models in 3D sets. This has become an outlet for multiple award-winning animated short films. It continues to make seemingly impossible ideas possible.</p>
