    <h1>My Artist Statement</h1>
     <p>My journey as an animator began when I was 13, and my journey as a filmmaker began 4 years later. But as a student, I lacked money or resources. I wanted a form of animation that could be faster, affordable, and just as impactful with limited resources. To fix this problem, I came up with a computer animation technique that used 2D-looking models in 3D sets. This has become an outlet for two award-winning pilots, and it continues to make seemingly impossible ideas possible.</p>
